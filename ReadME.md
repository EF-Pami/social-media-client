# Workflow CA

In this CA we are tasked with applying workflow skills in installing code formatting tools, configuration and code testing.

# GitHub repository

I fork the gitHub repository from the gitHub provided in the CA brief and clone it to my gitHub desktop. Created the workflow branch in which i did all the workflow tasks and committed into the workflow branch.
Open the github repo on vscode and use the vscode terminal to install and configure the different extensions for the workflow CA.
